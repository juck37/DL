# Week 4 NLP Disaster Tweets Kaggle Project

### Problem and goals
While twitter can be a powerful tool for broadcasting real-time disaster information, the informal and often metaphorical nature of language on the platform creates a significant challenge. The goal is to build a machine learning method that can automatically classify tweets as either reporting a genuine disaster or not. This model will help organizations filter out irrelevant noise and respond more effectively to real-world emergencies.
